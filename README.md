Not sure if this will work
omg it worked!
I have a nervous anticipation for this class
I don't know if I'm supposed to type 1st commit everytime
I have a job interview after class tomorrow. Cross your fingers for me
I think I need to consider shorter nails which makes me sad and will make my friends and my cat sad also
but trying to type with these stilettos is even more sad
I'm super excited for this class ><
What does the -m after git commit mean?
I can't believe humans have figured all this stuff out.
I have all the steps memorized but we'll see if I remember when I come back.
Last change and then I'm going to turn in this assignment, eat, then look up what other changes I can make
